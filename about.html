			<h1> About Me</h1>
			I'm a third year Computer Science student at UC San Diego with a passion for technology. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Last summer I had an internship developing Java software for a smart grid analytics application using Spring MVC, Hibernate, Maven, and MySQL.  
			<br />
			<br />
			Through my education and job experience, I have spent much time working on web application teams gaining experience in full stack implementation. 
			<br />
			<br />
			I am also particularly fascinated by data structures; I have begun a practical tutorial on basic data structures and hope to explore more complex structures in the future.
			<br />
			<br />
			The goal of this website is twofold: To show some early ideas I had about creating educational resources for newer programmers, and to showcase several projects I have worked on.
			As such, this is repository is a prototype.
			<br />
			<br />
			I'm looking for a internship doing software development, if you have any inquiries you can reach me at <b>knevalsky@gmail.com</b>.
